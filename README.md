# Portfoilio Site - [bryanburnett.com](https://bryanburnett.com/#)

A static site I've built to help keep track of my progress, post a little about myself, and most importantly present my abilities and continual effort to improve at coding. The framework was built off a template, but it helped me identify a structure of which I was able to manipulate and populate to my creative whim. As I progress I hope to make the site more unique and really use as a jumping off point for artistic endevors.
